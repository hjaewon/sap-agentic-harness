# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [4.13.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **ABAP Unit execution never worked on on-prem releases** — `RunUnitTest` (and the run_id readers `GetUnitTestStatus` / `GetUnitTestResult` / `GetUnitTest`) posted to `/sap/bc/adt/abapunit/runs`, the ABAP-Cloud-only async API; live ADT discovery on both S/4HANA 2021 and BASIS 7.00 confirms the collection does not exist there (HTTP 404). The high-level handlers now use the classic Eclipse-ADT endpoint (`POST /sap/bc/adt/abapunit/testruns` with a `testruns.config.v1+xml` runConfiguration — including the `<options>` block whose absence makes SAP silently select zero tests, the trap the legacy path sits in) and bridge the synchronous response into the existing run_id contract via an in-memory, **connection-scoped**, TTL-bounded store (30 min / 200 runs, checked on read and write). Container-class names are URI-encoded (namespaced objects), responses without an `<aunit:runResult>` root are rejected instead of cached, the synchronous call gets a ≥5-minute timeout, per-`test_class` sub-selection being unsupported by the classic protocol is stated in the response, and `format:"junit"` is rejected explicitly. Verified live on S/4HANA 2021: 2 test classes / 4 methods, all pass.
- **`CreateFunctionGroup` failed with HTTP 400 ("Daten sind ungültig und konnten nicht konvertiert werden") on systems advertising only `groups.v2`** — the vendored client hardcodes `functions.groups.v3+xml` (its own `ACCEPT_FUNCTION_GROUP` is "v2, v1" — asymmetric). The handler now negotiates the content type from the live ADT discovery document (quote/slash/absolute-href tolerant extraction, highest advertised version, per-connection cache; falls back to current defaults when discovery is silent). The legacy branch is untouched and skips negotiation entirely. A/B-probed on the same payload: v3→400, v2→200; verified create+activate+delete live.

## [4.13.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **`ReleaseTransport`** (high-level) — release a transport request or task via the ADT CTS release action (`POST /sap/bc/adt/cts/transportrequests/<trkorr>/newreleasejobs`). Completes the transport lifecycle (previously only create/get/list existed, so releases had to happen in SE09/SE10/STMS outside the server). The readonly guard auto-classifies it as mutating (DEV-only; blocked on QA/PRD). Response parsing (`parseReleaseJobResponse`) is defensive across the varying release-report / refreshed-request / job-acknowledgement shapes SAP returns — unknown shapes yield nulls plus a raw excerpt rather than silently dropping data. **The compact matrix is intentionally unchanged** (`ReleaseTransport` is high-level only). Because the ADT release action is absent from this repo's captured discovery document, a 404/405 is surfaced as a success payload `{ supported: false, hint: ... }` (mirroring `GetInstalledComponents`) instead of a tool error.

### Changed
- **ADT exception XML in HTTP error responses is now parsed into readable text.** The central `return_error` path previously truncated an `<exc:exception>` error body to 2000 chars of raw XML; it now routes such bodies through the existing `extractAdtErrorMessage` parser to produce `SAP Error: <message> [HTTP nnn]`. Non-XML bodies, the object branch, and the network-error mappings (ENOTFOUND/ECONNREFUSED/ETIMEDOUT) are unchanged. `GetObjectInfo`'s error-entry filter was widened (`Error: <?xml` → `Error:`) so parsed error text is still skipped when scanning SearchObject results.

### Docs
- README tool counts re-synced to the generator (`AVAILABLE_TOOLS.md` is the source of truth): total **287 → 339**, Read-Only 52→70, High-Level 113→135 (includes the 22 Compact), Low-Level 122→134. `tools/generate-tools-docs.js` now emits a non-fatal drift warning when a README advertises a total that no longer matches the code-derived count.

## [4.12.0] - 2026-07-07

### Security
- **Readonly guard rewritten fail-closed.** The tier guard classified mutations by `Create*`/`Update*`/`Delete*` name prefix only; an audit of the full 338-tool registry found ~60 mutating tools that bypassed it on QA/PRD profiles — `Activate*` (17), `Lock*`/`Unlock*` (35), `PatchGuiStatus`, `WriteTextElementsBulk`, and the compact dispatchers `HandlerCreate`/`HandlerUpdate`/`HandlerDelete`/`HandlerActivate`/`HandlerLock`/`HandlerUnlock`/`HandlerTransportCreate`. On QA/PRD a tool is now allowed only if positively classified read-only (read prefixes / compact read set) or by the execution matrix; unknown and future tools are blocked by default. Unit-test execution (`RunUnitTest`, `RunClassUnitTestsLow`, `HandlerUnitTestRun`) stays QA-allowed; profiling runs (`RuntimeRun*`, `HandlerProfileRun`) stay DEV-only.

### Fixed
- Empty `SAP_RFC_BACKEND=` resolves to the documented `odata` default instead of silently selecting the legacy `soap` backend (leftover from the 2026-04-22 default switch).

### Added
- Regression suite for the 4.8.3 keychain bug: session-store seeding must resolve `keychain:<service>/<account>` references to plaintext (literal pass-through caused 401 → account lockout after 3 tries); missing keychain entries surface as errors.

### Changed
- Fork identity completed: `server.json` / `glama.json` / README links / CONTRIBUTORS now consistently `@hjaewon` (4.9.0 had only migrated `package.json`); changelog backfilled for 4.7.0–4.8.2.
- CI: SAP-independent unit suites (`__tests__/lib`, `__tests__/unit`) are a required gate (previously all tests were advisory via `continue-on-error`); package smoke-install glob follows the `@hjaewon` scope; release notes install snippet and docs link corrected.

## [4.11.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- `GetCallGraph` — read-only call-relationship graph via server-side BFS (replaces dozens of chained `GetWhereUsed` round-trips). `direction` callers (where-used traversal) / callees (source fetch + dependency scan) / both, `depth` 1-4, `max_nodes` cap with `truncated` flag, `custom_only` gate (standard SAP objects appear as leaves but are not expanded). Function modules discovered mid-traversal resolve their function group from the where-used reference URI; unresolvable ones are marked `expandable:false`. Static analysis only — dynamic calls / BAdI dispatch are not captured. Object-level nodes (method-scoped where-used is not exposed by the ADT client wrapper).

### Notes
- Phase 3 (vsp package-analysis suite: health/slim/boundaries/api-surface) intentionally NOT ported to the server — those are composition pipelines best built as sc4sap skills over existing primitives. GetCallGraph is the only Phase-3 item that belongs server-side (round-trip/token economics).

## [4.10.2] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- `UpdateInterface` never passed `transport_request` to the ADT update call (`corrNr` URL param) — it was only echoed in the response, so updates to interfaces in transportable packages relied on the object already being in an open task. Now forwarded like `UpdateClass`; also fixes `UpdateSourceByPatch` on INTF.

## [4.10.1] - 2026-07-06

Codex review fixes on the 4.10.0 vsp-adopt tools (3 verified P2 findings).

### Fixed
- `GetClassMethod` / `UpdateClassMethod`: method statement parser now accepts AMDP additions (`METHOD x BY DATABASE PROCEDURE ...`, including multi-line statements) and namespaced names (`/iwbep/if_x~method`) — previously reported such methods as missing and rejected valid replacement blocks.
- `GrepPackages` / `GrepObjects`: an object exceeding the 20000-line scan cap no longer aborts the whole package scan as if `max_results` were reached; per-object truncation is now reported separately (`truncated_object` / distinct skip reason) and the global stop only triggers on the actual match budget.
- `GetSourceDiff`: common prefix/suffix trimming before the LCS matrix plus a hard 4M-cell guard — two large mostly-identical sources no longer allocate O(N*M) memory, and fully-differing oversized inputs return a structured `too_large` result instead of stalling the server.

## [4.10.0] - 2026-07-06

vsp ([vibing-steampunk](https://github.com/oisee/vibing-steampunk)) feature adoption — token-efficiency and code-intelligence tools.

### Added
- `UpdateSourceByPatch` — surgical old_string/new_string patch edit for CLAS/PROG/INTF/INCL/FUNC; uniqueness-validated, delegates to the existing Update* flows (lock → syntax check → update → unlock → optional activate) so a broken patch never lands.
- `GetClassMethod` / `UpdateClassMethod` — method-level read/edit for classes (~95% token reduction vs full-class round-trips); splices a single METHOD block and revalidates the whole class before writing.
- `CheckSyntax` — standalone read-only syntax check (proposed source for CLAS/PROG/INTF; current inactive version for INCL/FUNC).
- `GetSourceDiff` — client-side unified diff between two ABAP objects (CLAS/PROG/INTF/INCL), dependency-free LCS implementation.
- `GrepObjects` / `GrepPackages` — regex source search across explicit object lists / package hierarchies (subpackage recursion, context lines, type filter, global max_results cap with early fetch stop). FUNC excluded structurally (package listings carry no parent function group).
- `GetSystemInfo` / `GetInstalledComponents` — system identity (SID/client/modern-vs-legacy stack hint) and software component list; degrade to `supported:false` instead of erroring on releases without the endpoints.
- `GetClass` / `GetInterface` / `GetProgram`: opt-in `with_context` + `context_max_deps` — appends a `dependency_context` JSON field with compressed public contracts (public section / interface / FM signature) of referenced objects, 7–30x smaller than fetching full dependency sources.

### Notes
- All new write tools follow the `Update*` prefix so sc4sap QA/Prod prefix guards cover them; everything else is read-only.
- MCP `tools/list` (default exposition): 144 → 153 tools.

## [4.9.1] - 2026-07-06

Codex review follow-ups on the 4.9.0 bundle distribution.

### Fixed
- `--version` resolved package.json two levels above the package root when run from the single-file bundle (`dist/server.bundle.cjs`); now walks upward so both bundled and unbundled layouts work.
- Removed `main` pointing at the executable bundle — `require()` of the package no longer boots the MCP server as an import side effect (CLI-only distribution).
- `getDefaultLogger()` (BaseMcpServer / EmbeddableMcpServer / handlerLogger) falls back to a no-op logger when `@babamba2/mcp-abap-adt-logger` is absent — the published tarball ships without it.
- Docs: `@mcp-abap-adt/core` references updated to `@hjaewon/abap-mcp-adt-powerup`, phantom `mcp-abap-adt-v2` bin references removed, library subpath import example marked source-checkout-only.
- Deduplicated `pino`/`pino-pretty` (were in both dependencies and devDependencies with different ranges).

## [4.9.0] - 2026-07-06

First release under `@hjaewon/abap-mcp-adt-powerup` (independent fork; upstream `@babamba2` remains at 4.8.4).

### Added
- `GetAtcFindings` — read-only ATC (ABAP Test Cockpit) findings tool: object → ADT URI resolution, worklist run, parsed findings with priority/check title/message. (`feat/atc-findings`)
- Single-file server bundle `dist/server.bundle.cjs` built with esbuild (`npm run bundle`). Internal `@babamba2/mcp-abap-*` runtime packages, MCP SDK, axios, XML/YAML parsers and zod are baked in; `pino`/`pino-pretty` (dynamic transport loading) and native optionals (`node-rfc`, `@napi-rs/keyring`) stay external.

### Changed
- npm distribution is now the bundle only: tarball 7 files / ~1.4MB, installs 2 runtime deps (+2 optional) instead of the full dependency tree. Verified identical MCP `tools/list` (144 tools) against the unbundled server.
- `bin/mcp-abap-adt` runs the bundle; nonexistent `mcp-abap-adt-v2` bin entry removed.
- Library subpath exports (`./handlers`, `./utils`, `./server`) removed from the published package — for library consumption use the upstream `@babamba2` package or this repo's source.

## [4.8.4] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- ECC 7.40 DDIC **read** fallback via OData RFC. 4 handlers (`GetTable / GetStructure / GetDataElement / GetDomain`) activate on `SAP_VERSION=ECC`, routing DDIC reads through server-side FMs (`ZMCP_ADT_DDIC_TABL_READ / _DTEL_READ / _DOMA_READ`) invoked via OData FunctionImports on `ZMCP_ADT_SRV`. `TABL_READ` covers both Table and Structure (TABL/STRU share TABL DDIC category). Validated 2026-04-29 on HKT-DEV (path=ecc-odata-rfc).
- `GetBadiImplementations` — new read-only handler to find Z/Y implementations of classic BAdI definitions. ECC-only: routes through `ZMCP_ADT_DDIC_BADI` bridge FM (SXS_ATTR-based lookup). Returns `kind=classic` with implementation list (`impl_name`, `impl_class`, `package`, `methods_redefined`) or `kind=unknown` for kernel BAdIs / non-existent definitions. Use during symptom analysis when a standard BAdI is implicated.
- `lib/odataRfc.ts`: 4 new adapters (`callDdicTablRead / DdicDtelRead / DdicDomaRead / DdicBadi`) + `DdicReadResult` / `DdicBadiResult` types.
- `lib/rfcBackend.ts`: 4 new wrappers + informative error for non-odata backends.

## [4.8.3] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- Keychain password resolution in broker-based auth path. `EnvFileSessionStore` (from `@babamba2/mcp-abap-adt-auth-stores`) reads `SAP_PASSWORD` raw from the .env file and does not know about `keychain:<service>/<account>` references, so `authBroker.getConnectionConfig()` returned the literal reference string as the Basic Auth password → 401 → account lockout after 3 tries. `profile.ts activateProfile()` only fixed `process.env.SAP_PASSWORD`, which the v2 broker architecture (`lib/utils.ts:515` "No fallback to getConfig()") does not read. `brokerFactory.ts` now calls `resolveSecret()` on both `createBrokerWithEnvFileStore` (Variant 2, --env=path) and `loadEnvFileIntoSessionStore` (Variant 3, cwd .env) and seeds the session store's `inMemoryUpdates` so downstream reads return plaintext.

## [4.8.2] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- Transport handlers (3 bugs): `ListTransports` parser looked for `tm:request` directly under `tm:workbench` and missed the `tm:modifiable` / `tm:released` middle layer — silently returned 0 transports (new `collectRequests()` walks every category × status combination). `GetTransport` unifies the S/4 single-TR path URL vs the ECC user-scoped list (new `owner` input param for cross-user queries on ECC; response gains `resolved_via` / `view_type`). Accept header now content-negotiates `transportorganizertree.v1+xml` alongside `transportorganizer.v1+xml` (S/4 rejected the latter with HTTP 406). Not-found throws `McpError(InvalidParams)` instead of returning a 200 all-nulls stub.

## [4.8.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- ECC 7.40 DDIC write fallback via OData RFC. 9 handlers (Domain/DataElement/Table × CRUD) activate on `SAP_VERSION=ECC`, routing DDIC writes through server-side FMs (`ZMCP_ADT_DDIC_{TABL,DTEL,DOMA,ACTIVATE}`) invoked via OData FunctionImports on `ZMCP_ADT_SRV`. Full implementations: Domain C/U/D + DataElement C/U/D (type_kind=domain only) + Table Delete. Inform-only: Table Create/Update (CDS-DDL translator deferred).
- `lib/odataRfc.ts`: `callDdicTabl / DdicDtel / DdicDoma / DdicActivate` + `DdicResult` type.
- `lib/rfcBackend.ts`: 4 new wrappers + informative error for non-odata backends.

## [4.8.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Multi-profile activation on server start (`profile.ts`) — `.sc4sap` profile files select the active SAP destination.
- Server-side readonly guard (`readonlyGuard.ts`) — tier-based (DEV/QA/PRD) block matrix that fires before every handler on non-DEV tiers; last line of defense independent of any client-side hook.
- Secrets management via `@napi-rs/keyring` (optional dep, `secrets.ts`) — `SAP_PASSWORD=keychain:<service>/<account>` resolves from the OS keychain.
- `ReloadProfile` handler (system/readonly) — escape hatch to switch back to a DEV profile.
- `zcl_mcp_rfc_http_handler.abap` sample + ZRFC_SETUP guide + architecture.html.

### Fixed
- Legacy SAP `GetPackage` emits a `legacy_limited` flag instead of throwing on missing metadata.

## [4.7.1] - 2026-04-19

### Changed
- Version-alignment release (package metadata only, no code changes).

## [4.7.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Runtime feeds: `RuntimeListFeeds` (descriptor+dumps+sm+gw single reader), `RuntimeListSystemMessages` (SM02), `RuntimeGetGatewayErrorLog` (/IWFND/ERROR_LOG list + detail), `RuntimeGetDumpById` `response_mode={payload,summary,both}`. ADT Atom-feed parsing ported locally (upstream adt-clients 3.10.2 does not expose the v5 FeedRepository).
- Mass activation: `ActivateObjects` — batch activation via a single `/sap/bc/adt/activation/runs` call, resolving cyclic cross-references that break per-include activation. `ActivateObjectLow` honors the input `uri`; `CreateInclude` gains `source_code` + `activate_main_program`.
- `PatchGuiStatus` (GUI status surgical patch) and `WriteTextElementsBulk` (text-elements bulk write).

## [4.5.2] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- Pre-commit hook via husky + lint-staged — auto-fixes formatting and lint issues before commit so CI stays green.

## [4.5.1] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- Rewrite `ListTransports` handler to use `AdtClient.getRequest().list()` with proper Accept negotiation instead of direct `connection.makeAdtRequest()`. Update `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` to 3.13.0.
- Add integration tests for `ListTransports` handler.

## [4.5.0] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- Give `SAP_AUTH_TYPE` priority over `SAP_JWT_TOKEN` in test helpers — fixes onprem basic-auth tests failing when OS has stale BTP JWT token (#24).

### Changed
- Update `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` to 3.12.0 — adds 415 Content-Type negotiation with auto-retry and caching. Accept correction enabled by default (#22, #23).

## [4.4.2] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- Guarantee unlock via `try-finally` in all update handlers — prevents locked objects when errors occur between lock and unlock (#22). Affected: UpdateProgram, UpdateClass, UpdateInterface, UpdateView, UpdateTable, UpdateStructure, UpdateDomain, UpdateServiceDefinition, UpdateDataElement.

## [4.4.1] - 2026-03-26

### Improved
- Rewrite `SearchObject` tool description with operation-first approach for better RAG discoverability (#21). Description now leads with action verbs (find, search, locate, check exists) instead of object type lists, so embedding vectors match user intent queries like "is there a program named X?".

## [4.4.0] - 2026-03-22

### Improved
- Enrich 15 tool descriptions with domain-specific keywords for better vector RAG discoverability (#20). Tools like `SearchObject`, `GetTypeInfo`, `GetTransaction`, `GetTableContents`, and others now include ABAP object type names (DEVC, CLAS, TABL, DDLS, BDEF, DDLX, etc.) so embedding-based tool discovery returns correct results.

## [4.3.2] - 2026-03-20

### Improved
- Suppress `ping` request logging in StreamableHttpServer and SseServer — ping is now silent unless debug logging is enabled, reducing log noise.

## [4.3.1] - 2026-03-20

### Improved
- StreamableHttpServer request logging now includes MCP method, tool name, destination, and completion status. Helps diagnose issues like #19 where health polls generate excessive `tools/list` noise.

## [4.3.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- `GET /mcp/health` endpoint for HTTP and SSE transports — lightweight health check without MCP protocol overhead. Returns `status`, `uptime`, `version`, `transport`, and `activeSessions` (SSE only). Resolves #18.
- Unit tests for health endpoint (both transports).

## [4.2.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Shorten `server.json` description to fit MCP registry 100-character limit.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **16 new Read\* tools** — read source code and metadata for all object types with CRUD handlers:
  ReadClass, ReadInterface, ReadProgram, ReadTable, ReadStructure, ReadView, ReadDomain,
  ReadDataElement, ReadFunctionModule, ReadFunctionGroup, ReadPackage, ReadServiceDefinition,
  ReadServiceBinding, ReadMetadataExtension, ReadBehaviorDefinition, ReadBehaviorImplementation.
- `transport_request` parameter for UpdateBehaviorDefinition (low), UpdateMetadataExtension (high).
- `record_changes` parameter for CreatePackage (high + low).
- Transported Object CRUD integration test reproducing GitHub #11 (transport lock issue on legacy systems).

### Fixed
- `SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE` now propagated from test config to `process.env`, so `createAdtClient` correctly selects `AdtClientLegacy` on legacy systems.
- `transport_request` passed in class update tests for transportable packages.
- UpdateDataElement now passes `transportRequest` to adt-clients.
- BDEF low test resilience: guaranteed BIMPL unlock via try/finally, delay after delete in cleanup, skip create if BDEF already exists (transport re-create limitation).
- Removed duplicate GetFunction handler (delegates to GetFunctionModule).
- Auto-detect JWT auth for `--env-path`, SAP_CLIENT auto-resolve.

## [4.1.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- Unit test `systemContext.test.ts` updated to match `SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE` env var approach (removed obsolete `isModernAdtSystem` mock).

## [4.1.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- `SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE` environment variable (`cloud` | `onprem` | `legacy`) to explicitly control SAP system type. Default: `cloud`.
- `--system-type` CLI argument as alternative to the env var.
- Eager HTTP session initialization — `connect()` is now called for all connection types (not just RFC), establishing CSRF token and cookies before the first request.

### Changed
- Removed unreliable auto-detection via `/sap/bc/adt/core/discovery`. System type is now determined solely by `SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE`.
- **Migration note:** on-premise users must set `SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE=onprem` in `.env` to access on-premise-only tools (e.g., Programs).

### Fixed
- 403 errors on first request to SAP systems (e.g., E96) that require pre-established session cookies.
- Inconsistent legacy detection across different shell environments, proxy configs, and ICM sessions.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Legacy system support (BASIS < 7.50)**: automatic detection of legacy systems, `AdtClientLegacy` factory, RFC connection transport via `SADT_REST_RFC_ENDPOINT`.
- **RFC connection type**: `--connection-type=rfc` CLI flag and `SAP_CONNECTION_TYPE=rfc` env var for legacy systems requiring SAP NW RFC SDK.
- **`available_in` mechanism**: each handler's `TOOL_DEFINITION` declares supported environments (`onprem`, `cloud`, `legacy`). Unsupported tools are hidden from clients at registration time.
- **Legacy `available_in` on 102 handlers**: Class, Interface, View, Program, Function Group/Module, Package (read/update/delete), Include, Unit Test, and common utilities.
- **FunctionGroup/FunctionModule on cloud**: previously restricted to on-premise only.
- **Runtime profiling and dumps on cloud**: class-based profiling now works on ABAP Cloud.
- **Shared dependencies management**: `npm run shared:setup` / `shared:teardown` / `shared:check` for test objects.
- **Test infrastructure**: `test:init` / `test:reinit` scripts, explicit connection config (`env`, `system_type`, `connection_type`) in `test-config.yaml`, `available_in` support in test cases for system-aware skipping.
- **AVAILABLE_TOOLS_LEGACY.md**: generated documentation listing 115 legacy-compatible tools.

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Node 18 dropped** — minimum Node.js version is now 20.0.0.
- **BREAKING: `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` upgraded** from 2.x to 3.11.2 (major API changes).
- **BREAKING: `@mcp-abap-adt/connection` upgraded** to 1.5.3.
- **CI matrix**: Node 20 + 25 on 3 OS for push/PR; Node 20/22/24/25 for release.
- **Guaranteed unlock**: force-release DDIC locks, unlock-on-error in CreateDataElement/CreateDomain.
- **TADIR conflict retry**: automatic retry on 409 TADIR conflict during create operations.

### Fixed
- Circular reference in CDS unit test handlers.
- i18n check handling (adt-clients 3.8.7).
- MetadataExtension high/low test object conflicts (separate config keys).
- Function test lock conflicts (separate high/low test objects).
- Package tests use `update()` for lock/unlock.
- Jest 30 deprecated `--testPathPattern` migrated to `--testPathPatterns`.
- `SAP_USER` → `SAP_USERNAME` in configuration examples.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **Integration test cleanup**: close MCP connections, reuse auth session, random ports.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **GetTableContents handler**: fully implemented — was a stub returning "temporarily unavailable", now reads table data via ADT Data Preview API with field extraction and SQL query generation.

### Changed
- **parseSqlQueryXml**: exported from `handleGetSqlQuery` for reuse in `GetTableContents`.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **BehaviorImplementation low-level MCP tools**: registered `ValidateBehaviorImplementationLow`, `CreateBehaviorImplementationLow`, `LockBehaviorImplementationLow` in LowLevelHandlersGroup.

### Fixed
- **System context not passed to AdtClient**: `createAdtClient()` now forwards `responsible` and `masterSystem` from resolved system context to `AdtClient` options. Fixes package creation on BTP Cloud failing with "Enter a valid user, not , as the person responsible".
- **ValidatePackageLow schema**: added missing `super_package` property to `inputSchema.properties` (was in `required` but not declared — MCP SDK rejected the parameter in hard mode).
- **CreatePackageLow handler**: removed incorrect `createResult` check — `AdtPackage.create()` returns `{ errors: [] }` without `createResult` (packages are containers with no response body).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Separate Create and Update** — Create handlers no longer accept source code. Use Update after Create to set source code.

## [2.7.5] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **MCP Registry publish**: sync `server.json` version with npm package version (`2.5.2` → `2.7.5`).

## [2.7.4] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **System context HTTP headers for HTTP/SSE transport**:
  - `x-sap-master-system` and `x-sap-responsible` headers allow per-request system context override.
  - Priority: HTTP headers → `process.env` → cloud `getSystemInformation()` API.
  - Enables on-prem transport request binding for HTTP/SSE connections without `.env` file.
- **System context cache isolation**: cache is reset before each non-stdio request to prevent stale values leaking between requests targeting different SAP systems.

## [2.7.3] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Release workflow lint gate** for `v2.7.2`:
  - Applied Biome formatting/import ordering fixes in updated hard-mode test infrastructure and integration suites.
  - Kept hard-mode behavior unchanged; this patch is focused on CI/release pipeline stability.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **YAML-driven MCP hard mode test infrastructure**:
  - Added `environment.integration_hard_mode` support for integration tests.
  - Added real MCP client execution path for `stdio`, `sse`, and `http` transports.
  - Added MCP CRUD smoke/matrix scripts in `tools/`.

### Fixed
- **Real MCP integration gaps in tests**:
  - Lambda-based integration suites now support hard mode via real MCP tool calls.
  - `LowTester` hard mode now bootstraps MCP session (`GetSession`) so low-level lock/unlock flows receive required `session_id`.
  - Hard mode test object names now include per-run suffix to prevent object name collisions between runs.
- **System context bootstrap on server startup**:
  - Launcher now hydrates on-prem system context env values earlier so real MCP runs consistently resolve context.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **`SAP_MASTER_SYSTEM` and `SAP_RESPONSIBLE`** documented in CLI help (`--help`) and `.env.example`.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **System context support for on-premise systems** (issue #11):
  - `masterSystem` and `responsible` are now passed to all ADT create/update XML requests via `IAdtSystemContext`.
  - On-prem resolution: `SAP_MASTER_SYSTEM` env var → `getSystemInformation()` API fallback (cloud).
  - Responsible resolution: `SAP_RESPONSIBLE` env var → `SAP_USERNAME` fallback → API.
  - Ensures correct transport request binding on on-premise systems.
- **New `.env` variables for on-premise configuration**:
  - `SAP_MASTER_SYSTEM` — SAP system ID (e.g., `E19`, `DEV`). Required for on-prem create/update operations.
  - `SAP_RESPONSIBLE` — Responsible user (optional, falls back to `SAP_USERNAME`).
- **Test infrastructure**: `resolveTestSystemContext()` resolves system context from YAML config for integration tests.

### Changed
- **Upgraded `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients`** from `^2.0.0` to `^2.2.0`.
- Renamed `default_system` → `default_master_system` in test config template.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **`UpdateProgram` missing `transport_request`**: Added `transport_request` to schema, interface, and `.update()` call — same fix as other handlers in 2.6.0.

### Changed
- **Upgraded `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients`** to `1.2.2`.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **`ListTransports` tool** (read-only):
  - Lists transport requests for the current or specified user.
  - Filters by modifiable status (default: modifiable only).
  - Use before create/update to find the correct transport request.

### Fixed
- **`transportRequest` forwarding in all high-level handlers** (issue #11):
  - Create handlers now forward `transportRequest` to the internal update (PUT) step: `CreateFunctionModule`, `CreateTable`, `CreateInterface`, `CreateView`, `CreateProgram`, `CreateDomain`, `CreateDataElement`.
  - Standalone update handlers now forward `transportRequest`: `UpdateStructure`, `UpdateDomain`, `UpdateServiceDefinition`.
  - Added `transport_request` to tool schemas where it was missing: `UpdateClass`, `UpdateView`, `UpdateBehaviorDefinition`.

### Changed
- **Upgraded `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients`** from `0.3.22` to `1.2.1`.

### Documentation
- Regenerated tools documentation:
  - `docs/user-guide/AVAILABLE_TOOLS.md`
  - `docs/user-guide/AVAILABLE_TOOLS_HIGH.md`
  - `docs/user-guide/AVAILABLE_TOOLS_LOW.md`
  - `docs/user-guide/AVAILABLE_TOOLS_COMPACT.md`
  - `docs/user-guide/AVAILABLE_TOOLS_READONLY.md`

## [2.5.2] - 2026-02-23
### Fixed
- **`--mcp` precedence over local `.env`**:
  - Fixed CLI fallback logic so `.env` from current working directory is no longer auto-loaded when `--mcp=<destination>` is provided.
  - Startup auth source display now correctly prioritizes `service-key: <destination>` over `.env`.
- **JWT auth error diagnostics**:
  - Improved HTTP/SSE request-time error reporting for missing JWT tokens by surfacing token provider failure reason in `BaseMcpServer`.
- **Auth broker runtime behavior**:
  - Fixed v2 auth-broker config to respect `--unsafe` instead of always forcing safe in-memory stores.

### Added
- **Browser OAuth callback port override**:
  - Added `--browser-auth-port=<port>` and `MCP_BROWSER_AUTH_PORT` to override auth callback server port (useful when default ports are occupied).
- **Inspector runtime dependency safety**:
  - Added explicit `express-rate-limit` dev dependency to avoid missing transitive package issues during `dev:http` inspector startup.

### Documentation
- Updated auth and CLI docs for `--mcp` behavior and browser auth callback port override:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/user-guide/AUTHENTICATION.md`
  - CLI help text via `ServerConfigManager`.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-02-21
### Changed
- **Compact handler descriptions**:
  - Reworked compact handler descriptions to be explicit and deterministic for tool routing.
  - Added per-`object_type` required parameter mapping directly in handler descriptions (`TYPE(param*)` format).

### Changed
- **Runtime profiling + dumps explorer**:
  - Refocused tool workflow to class-based profiling run flow.
  - Improved ABAP user resolution/validation and diagnostics for dumps/traces filtering.
  - Improved object validation/update flow and trace feed handling in interactive tool.

- **Architecture documentation**:
  - Added comprehensive architecture document: `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Changed
- **Runtime payload format**:
  - Runtime profiling and dump handlers now return parsed JSON payloads (instead of raw XML strings in `payload`).
  - Runtime dump read uses `dump_id` input (`RuntimeGetDumpById`) instead of URI-based input.
- **Dependencies**:

### Documentation
- Regenerated tools docs (`docs/user-guide/AVAILABLE_TOOLS*.md`) with runtime diagnostics tools.
- Updated `README.md` feature list with runtime diagnostics capabilities.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-13
### Fixed
- **YAML config flag compatibility**:
  - Added `--conf` support as an alias for `--config` in argument parsing.
  - Fixed YAML template flow: when config file is missing, template generation now exits cleanly instead of continuing into inspection-only mode.
- **YAML env config clarity**:
  - Added `env-path` YAML option to map directly to `--env-path`.
  - Clarified `env` as destination name and removed duplicate `allowed-origins` entry in template.
- **HTTP/SSE connection context resolution**:
  - Enforced priority: `x-mcp-destination` header -> server default destination (`--mcp` / `--env-path`) -> `400` error.
  - HTTP default-destination broker initialization now uses the resolved destination key.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-13
### Changed
- **.env parsing policy**:
  - Inline comments are no longer parsed from values.
  - `#` is treated as a comment only when it starts the line.
  - This avoids accidental truncation of secrets containing `#` (for example passwords/tokens).
- **Update tool error handling**:
  - Added unified ADT/SAP error extraction for update handlers to improve `409` conflict diagnostics.
  - XML exception payloads (`exc:exception`) are now surfaced as detailed user-facing errors in previously generic update flows.
- **GetTypeInfo structure fallback**:
  - Added optional structure lookup fallback (`include_structure_fallback`, default: `true`).
  - Fallback is executed only when type lookups return `404` or empty result.
  - Non-`404` errors no longer silently fall through to unrelated lookups.

### Documentation
- Updated `.env` comments guidance in:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/user-guide/AUTHENTICATION.md`

## [2.2.7] - 2026-02-12
### Fixed
- **CI (Biome)**: Applied formatting fixes required by `npx biome check src --diagnostic-level=error`.
  - `src/handlers/function_module/high/handleGetFunctionModule.ts`
  - `src/lib/config/envResolver.ts`

## [2.2.6] - 2026-02-12
### Changed
- **Function Module handlers**: Fixed parameter propagation for function module operations:
  - `GetFunctionModule` and `DeleteFunctionModule` now require and pass `function_group_name`.
  - `GetFunction` (read-only) now requires and passes `function_group`.
  - `UpdateFunctionModule` (high/low) now forwards `transport_request` to ADT update calls.
- **CLI env resolution**: Updated env argument behavior:
  - `--env=<name>` now resolves to platform sessions path: `{sessions}/<name>.env`.
  - Added `--env-path=<path|file>` for explicit `.env` file usage.
  - `MCP_ENV_PATH` now maps to explicit env file path behavior (same as `--env-path`).
- **Errors**: Improved function module update error messages for transport-related `400` responses and XML SAP errors.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-02-11
### Changed
- **Tools docs generator**: Reworked `tools/generate-tools-docs.js` to scan only handler code in `src/handlers/**`.
- **Tools docs structure**: Updated `docs/user-guide/AVAILABLE_TOOLS.md` hierarchy to `Group (level) → Object (folder) → Tools`.
- **Coverage fix**: Ensured BDEF and other handler folders are included consistently in generated tools documentation.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-02-11
### Changed
- **Discoverability metadata**: Updated npm keywords and package metadata to improve MCP search relevance for ABAP, ABAP Cloud, JWT/XSUAA, and service-key flows.
- **Registry description**: Shortened `server.json` description to meet the MCP publisher 100-character constraint.
- **README positioning**: Clarified first-screen value proposition around full CRUD, On-Premise + ABAP Cloud support, and auth options.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-02-10

- Removed the accidental `@mcp-abap-adt/core` dependency that caused consumers to download the old `1.4.1` tarball.

## [2.0.3] - 2025-12-31
### Changed
- **@mcp-abap-adt/auth-broker**: bumped to `0.2.15` so the locked dependency pulls in the latest fixes referenced by the release.

### Fixed
- **CI workflow package install**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now looks for `mcp-abap-adt-core-*.tgz`, matching the actual npm pack output before testing global install.

## [2.0.2] - 2025-12-30
### Changed
- **GetWhereUsed handler**: Now uses `getWhereUsedList()` from adt-clients and returns parsed JSON with structured references instead of raw XML

- **GetFunction** tool: Updated to support `version` parameter and migrated to new `adt-clients` signature.
- **High-level handlers**: Improved parameter handling and consistency with new `adt-clients` versioning requirements.
- Test cleanup documentation updated to clarify `afterEach` behavior and multi-object cleanup requirements.
- Test runners (`LowTester`/`HighTester`) now emit step-level flow logs for validate/create/lock/update/unlock/activate.
- Package cleanup can use a fresh connection with optional `connection_config` for locked session cases.

### Fixed
- Package create now treats ADT "import" 404 as success when the package is readable.
- Function group/module low-level create handles transient 400/empty responses with read verification.

  - Handlers registered immediately in constructor - no `run()` method needed
  - Access underlying `McpServer` via `.mcpServer` getter
  - Configurable `exposition` levels: `readonly`, `high`, `low`, `system`
  
### Removed
- `mcp_abap_adt_server` class (was 3000+ lines with CLI, transports, AuthBroker)
- `setAbapConnectionOverride()` function
- `ServerOptions` interface
- All CLI argument parsing
- All transport management (stdio, SSE, streamable-http)
- AuthBroker integration
- .env file loading logic

### Migration Guide
**For embedding in external servers (cloud-llm-hub, etc.):**
```typescript
// Before (1.2.x)
import { mcp_abap_adt_server } from '@fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt/server/v1';
const server = new mcp_abap_adt_server({ connection, allowProcessExit: false });
server.registerHandlers({ connection, logger });

// After (1.2.2)
import { EmbeddableMcpServer } from '@fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt/server/v1';
const server = new EmbeddableMcpServer({
  context: { connection, logger },
  exposition: ['readonly', 'high']
});
const mcpServer = server.mcpServer; // Use with transport
```

## [1.2.1] - 2025-12-22
### Added
- **Subpath export `./utils`** for internal utilities access
  - `@fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt/utils` - exports `sessionContext`, `getManagedConnection`, and other utilities
  - Required for cloud-llm-hub integration to access session context

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-21
### Changed
- **BREAKING: v2 is now the default server**
  - `mcp-abap-adt` command now runs v2 server (was v1)
  - v1 server moved to `legacy-server.ts`, accessible via `npm run start:legacy`
  - Removed separate `mcp-abap-adt-v2` binary

- **v1 becomes Handler Exporter**
  - v1/index.ts now exports `HandlerExporter` class for external server integration
  - Allows registering ABAP ADT handlers on any McpServer instance
  - Designed for embedding into existing Express/CDS/CAP servers (e.g., cloud-llm-hub)

### Added
- **Subpath exports** for modular imports
  - `@fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt` - main package (unchanged)
  - `@fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt/handlers` - HandlerExporter and handler groups
  - `@fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt/server/v1` - v1 module (exporter + legacy server)
  - v2 server is internal, not exported as subpath

- **HandlerExporter class** for programmatic handler registration
  - `new HandlerExporter(options?)` - create exporter with configurable handler groups
  - `registerOnServer(mcpServer, connectionProvider)` - register handlers with connection injection
  - `getHandlerEntries()` - get raw handler entries for custom registration
  - `getToolNames()` - list all available tool names
  - `createRegistry()` - create IHandlersRegistry for v2 servers

- **Handler Groups** - modular handler organization
  - `ReadOnlyHandlersGroup` - read-only handlers (getProgram, getClass, etc.)
  - `HighLevelHandlersGroup` - high-level operations
  - `LowLevelHandlersGroup` - low-level operations
  - `SystemHandlersGroup` - system handlers
  - `SearchHandlersGroup` - search handlers

### Migration Guide
**For CLI users:**
- No changes needed - `mcp-abap-adt` command works the same
- To use legacy v1 server: `npm run start:legacy`

**For library users (cloud-llm-hub, etc.):**
```typescript
// Old way (v1 server class) - still works via legacy import
import { mcp_abap_adt_server } from '@fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt';

// New way (handler exporter) - recommended
import { HandlerExporter } from '@fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt/handlers';

const exporter = new HandlerExporter();
exporter.registerOnServer(mcpServer, () => getConnection());
```

**For CAP/CDS projects with file: dependency:**
Add path mapping to tsconfig.json:
```json
{
  "paths": {
    "@fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt/handlers": ["./submodules/mcp-abap-adt/dist/lib/handlers/index"]
  }
}
```

  - Created `doc/user-guide/usage/` directory with structured documentation
  - **Simple Objects** (22 files): High-level and low-level handlers for 11 object types:
    - Classes, Interfaces, Programs, Function Groups, Function Modules
    - Tables, Structures, CDS Views, Domains, Data Elements, Service Definitions
    - Each object has separate `-high.md` and `-low.md` files with exact MCP call examples

  - Fixed type narrowing in catch and finally blocks

## [1.1.25] - 2025-12-12

### Added
- **`--mcp=<destination>` parameter** – Default MCP destination name for auth-broker:
  - Allows using auth-broker (service keys) with stdio and SSE transports
  - When specified, this destination is used when `x-mcp-destination` header is not provided in requests
  - For stdio transport: Server initializes auth-broker with the specified destination at startup
  - For SSE transport: Server uses the specified destination as fallback when header is missing
  - For HTTP transport: Server uses the specified destination as fallback when header is missing
  - Example: `mcp-abap-adt --transport=stdio --mcp=TRIAL`
  - This enables auth-broker usage with stdio and SSE transports, which previously required `.env` file configuration

### Changed
- **Auth-broker support for stdio and SSE transports** – Extended `getOrCreateAuthBroker()` to support stdio and SSE transports:
  - Previously, auth-broker was only available for HTTP/streamable-http transport
  - Now works with all transport types when `--mcp` parameter is specified
  - For stdio: Auth-broker is initialized at server startup with the destination from `--mcp` parameter
  - For SSE: Auth-broker works the same way as HTTP transport (via headers or `--mcp` fallback)

### Fixed
- **`--mcp` parameter now skips `.env` file loading** – When `--mcp` is specified:
  - `.env` file is not automatically loaded (even if it exists in current directory)
  - `.env` file is not considered mandatory for stdio and SSE transports
  - Auth-broker configuration takes precedence over `.env` file
  - This ensures that `--mcp` parameter works correctly without conflicts from `.env` file settings
- **SSE transport with `--mcp` parameter** – Fixed issue where SSE transport was using `.env` configuration instead of auth-broker when `--mcp` was specified:
  - Server now initializes auth-broker at startup for SSE transport when `--mcp` is provided
  - `applyAuthHeaders()` now handles empty headers correctly when `defaultMcpDestination` is set
  - Configuration from auth-broker takes precedence over `.env` file

### Documentation
- Updated `CLI_OPTIONS.md` with `--mcp` parameter documentation and examples
- Updated `CLIENT_CONFIGURATION.md` with information about using `--mcp` parameter for stdio and SSE transports
- Added examples for Cline configuration with stdio transport and `--mcp` parameter
- Updated help text in both `src/index.ts` and `bin/mcp-abap-adt.js` with `--mcp` parameter information

## [1.1.24] - 2025-12-02

### Changed
- **Safe session storage by default** – Session data is now stored in-memory using `SafeSessionStore` by default:
  - Session tokens are no longer persisted to disk by default (secure by default)
  - Session data is lost after server restart (requires re-authentication)
  - Use `--unsafe` flag to enable file-based session storage (legacy behavior)
  - File-based storage (`UnixFileSessionStore`/`WindowsFileSessionStore`) is only used when `--unsafe` is specified

### Added
- **`--unsafe` flag** – Enables file-based session storage (persists tokens to disk):
  - When specified, session data is saved to platform-specific locations:
    - Unix: `~/.config/mcp-abap-adt/sessions/{destination}.env`
    - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\mcp-abap-adt\sessions\{destination}.env`
  - Can be set via environment variable: `MCP_UNSAFE=true`
  - Use this flag if you need session persistence across server restarts

### Dependencies
- Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-broker` to `^0.1.5`:
  - Benefits from new `SafeSessionStore` implementation (in-memory, secure)
  - Updated to use new `ISessionStore` interface (replaces `SessionStore`)

## [1.1.23] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- **Help text correction** – fixed incorrect help message for `x-mcp-destination` header:
  - Removed incorrect statement that `x-mcp-destination` requires `x-sap-url` header
  - Updated help text to correctly state that URL is automatically derived from service key (same as `x-sap-destination`)
  - Help text now accurately reflects that `x-sap-url` is not required and will be ignored if provided

## [1.1.22] - 2025-12-01

### Dependencies
- Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` to `^0.1.33`:
  - Benefits from optimized CSRF token endpoint (`/sap/bc/adt/core/discovery`)
  - Faster connection initialization for all CRUD operations
- Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-broker` to `^0.1.4`:
  - Benefits from optimized CSRF token endpoint in connection layer
  - Faster authentication flows when managing JWT tokens

### Added
- **ABAP Unit class test tools**: Added `[low-level]` handlers to cover the new CrudClient APIs for class test includes and ABAP Unit orchestration:
  - `LockClassTestClassesLow`, `UpdateClassTestClassesLow`, `UnlockClassTestClassesLow`, `ActivateClassTestClassesLow`
  - `RunClassUnitTestsLow`, `GetClassUnitTestStatusLow`, `GetClassUnitTestResultLow`
  - All new tools live in `class/low/` and are registered with the server and documentation generator.
- **Package creation options**: `CreatePackage` (high- and low-level) now accepts optional `package_type`, `software_component`, `transport_layer`, `application_component`, and `responsible` parameters and forwards them directly to `CrudClient`, enabling Cloud systems to pass values such as `ZLOCAL` while keeping the transport layer empty.

## [1.1.21] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- **x-mcp-destination validation** – fixed issue where `x-mcp-destination` header was incorrectly requiring `x-sap-url`:
  - `x-mcp-destination` now works identically to `x-sap-destination` - URL is automatically derived from service key
  - `x-sap-url` is now optional for `x-mcp-destination` (and will be ignored with a warning if provided)
  - Fixed issue on Windows where `x-mcp-destination` was being ignored
  - Updated header validator to check headers in both lowercase and original case for better compatibility

### Added
- **Custom auth-broker path** – added `--auth-broker-path` command-line option:
  - Allows specifying custom base path for service keys and sessions
  - Automatically creates `service-keys` and `sessions` subdirectories in the specified path
  - Example: `--auth-broker-path=~/prj/tmp/` uses `~/prj/tmp/service-keys/` and `~/prj/tmp/sessions/`
  - Directories are created automatically if they don't exist
  - Can be used together with `--auth-broker` flag

- **Automatic directory creation** – service keys and sessions directories are now created automatically:
  - Directories are created at server startup if they don't exist
  - Prevents errors when saving sessions for the first time
  - Works for both default platform paths and custom `--auth-broker-path`

- **Enhanced startup information** – improved auth-broker path display at server startup:
  - Shows all search paths for service keys (in order of priority)
  - Shows all save paths for sessions
  - Formatted with clear visual separators for better readability
  - Only displayed when `--auth-broker` flag is used

- **Diagnostic logging** – added platform-aware logging for better debugging:
  - Logs platform information when processing authentication headers
  - Logs all header keys that start with `x-sap` or `x-mcp`
  - Logs search paths when creating AuthBroker instances
  - Helps diagnose issues on different platforms (especially Windows)

### Changed
- **Header validation logic** – improved validation order and case handling:
  - `x-mcp-destination` is now checked immediately after `x-sap-destination`, regardless of `x-sap-url` presence
  - Added case-insensitive header checking for better compatibility
  - Both `x-sap-destination` and `x-mcp-destination` now check headers in both lowercase and original case

- **Documentation updates** – comprehensive documentation improvements:
  - Added `--auth-broker-path` parameter documentation in help text
  - Updated `CLIENT_CONFIGURATION.md` with custom path examples
  - Updated `INSTALLATION.md` with new command-line option
  - Updated `SERVICE_KEY_SETUP.md` with custom path usage examples
  - Added Cline configuration example in help text

### Dependencies

- **Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/header-validator` to `^0.1.3`** – upgraded to latest version

## [1.1.20] - 2025-12-01

### Changed
- **Help documentation improvements** – updated help messages with detailed instructions for saving service keys:
  - Added platform-specific instructions for Linux, macOS, and Windows
  - Replaced example JSON structure with instructions to copy service key from SAP BTP
  - Fixed backslash escaping in Windows PowerShell commands
  - Updated both launcher help (`bin/mcp-abap-adt.js`) and server help (`src/index.ts`)
  - Updated documentation files: `SERVICE_KEY_SETUP.md` and `CLIENT_CONFIGURATION.md`

## [1.1.19] - 2025-11-30

### Changed
- **Handler refactoring** – migrated handlers to use `CrudClient` and `SharedBuilder` from `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients`:
  - `handleSearchObject` now uses `SharedBuilder.search()` instead of manual URL construction
  - Eliminates redundant URL concatenation and potential duplication errors
  - Better code reuse and consistency across handlers

- **URL handling simplification** – removed unnecessary URL cleaning logic:
  - URLs from `.env` files and service keys are expected to be clean
  - Removed aggressive URL cleaning that was causing issues
  - Only basic trimming is performed where needed

- **Transport-specific auth-broker handling** – `auth-broker` is now ignored for `stdio` and `sse` transports:
  - AuthBroker initialization is skipped for non-HTTP transports
  - Prevents unnecessary errors and resource usage
  - `.env` file is used directly for `stdio` and `sse` transports

### Fixed
- **URL duplication in stdio transport** – fixed incorrect URL formation when using `stdio` transport:
  - Resolved `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND ...comhttps` errors
  - Proper URL handling in connection initialization
  - Correct `.env` file parsing for `stdio` mode

### Added
- **Lazy AuthBroker initialization** – AuthBroker instances are now created on-demand per destination:
  - AuthBroker is only created when a destination is actually needed (not at server startup)
  - Each destination gets its own AuthBroker instance, cached in a map for reuse
  - Reduces memory usage and startup time when auth-broker is not needed
  - Default AuthBroker instance for non-destination requests

- **Improved method filtering** – only `tools/call` requires SAP configuration:
  - All other MCP methods (`tools/list`, `tools/get`, `initialize`, `ping`, `notifications/initialized`, etc.) work without SAP config
  - Prevents unnecessary authentication errors for metadata requests
  - Better separation between metadata operations and actual tool execution

### Changed
- **AuthBroker instance management** – switched from single instance to per-destination map:
  - `authBrokers` map stores AuthBroker instances keyed by destination name
  - `defaultAuthBroker` for requests without specific destination
  - Lazy initialization via `getOrCreateAuthBroker()` method
  - Better isolation between different destinations

- **Platform store imports** – fixed ES module compatibility:
  - Replaced `require()` with static imports in `getPlatformStores()`
  - Fixes "UnixFileSessionStore is not a constructor" error
  - Proper ES module support for platform-specific stores

### Fixed
- **ES module compatibility** – fixed "UnixFileSessionStore is not a constructor" error:
  - Changed `getPlatformStores()` to use static imports instead of `require()`
  - Properly handles ES module exports for Unix/Windows store implementations
  - AuthBroker now correctly initializes on Unix systems

- **Request processing logic** – improved handling of requests that don't require SAP connection:
  - Only `tools/call` method triggers SAP configuration validation
  - All other methods bypass authentication checks
  - Prevents false errors for metadata and initialization requests

## [1.1.17] - 2025-11-28

### Added
- **Cross-platform session storage** – optional persistent session management:
  - Session storage now disabled by default (stateless mode)
  - Enable via `MCP_ENABLE_SESSION_STORAGE=true` environment variable
  - Custom session directory via `MCP_SESSION_DIR=/path/to/sessions`
  - Platform-specific defaults: Windows temp dir, `/tmp` on Linux, `/var/folders` on macOS
  - Prevents `ENOENT` errors when running from different working directories

- **Cline configuration documentation** – comprehensive setup guide:
  - Created `doc/installation/CLINE_CONFIGURATION.md` with detailed configuration for all transport types
  - Added example configs in `doc/installation/examples/` for NPX, global install, and local development

  - Moved from relative `.sessions` path to absolute paths using `os.tmpdir()`
  - Session storage now optional and controlled by environment variables
  - Removed `FileSessionStorage` usage from individual handlers (e.g., `handleDeletePackage`)
  - All session management now centralized in connection manager (`utils.ts`)

- **Environment variable documentation** – comprehensive env var reference:
  - Added table of all available environment variables in Cline configuration docs
  - Documented `MCP_ENABLE_SESSION_STORAGE` and `MCP_SESSION_DIR` usage
  - Platform-specific default values and examples
  - Guidance on when to enable/disable session storage

### Fixed
- **Session directory creation errors** – fixed `ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/.sessions'`:
  - Replaced relative `.sessions` path with absolute paths
  - Session directory now uses OS-specific temp directory by default
  - Works correctly when running as global npm package or via npx
  - No longer depends on current working directory

- **Handler session management** – simplified connection handling:
  - Removed custom `FileSessionStorage` creation in `handleDeletePackage`
  - Deprecated `force_new_connection` parameter (now ignored)
  - All connections use centralized session management
  - Restart server to force new session instead of per-handler sessions

### Dependencies
- No dependency changes in this release

## [1.1.16] - 2025-01-XX

### Removed
- **dotenv dependency** – completely removed `dotenv` package from dependencies:
  - Eliminated `dotenv` as a dependency to prevent stdout pollution in stdio mode
  - Resolved `"[dotenv@17."... is not valid JSON` error that was breaking stdio transport
  - Server now uses manual `.env` file parsing for all transport modes

### Changed
- **.env file parsing** – replaced `dotenv` library with manual parsing:
  - Manual `.env` file parsing for all transport modes (stdio, http, sse)
  - Supports both Unix (`\n`) and Windows (`\r\n`) line endings
  - Handles comments, quoted values, and empty lines correctly
  - Cross-platform compatible (works on Linux, Windows, macOS)
  - No external dependencies for environment variable loading

- **stdio mode auto-detection** – improved stdio mode detection:
  - Auto-detects stdio mode when `stdin` is not a TTY (piped by MCP Inspector or other tools)
  - Checks `!process.stdin.isTTY` in addition to command-line arguments and environment variables
  - Allows seamless connection from MCP Inspector and other stdio-based clients without explicit `--transport=stdio` flag

- **stderr handling in stdio mode** – restored stderr for error logging:
  - Following reference implementation pattern, stderr is now available for error logging in stdio mode
  - stdout remains reserved exclusively for MCP JSON-RPC protocol
  - console.error() and console.warn() now work correctly in stdio mode (write to stderr)

### Fixed
- **stdio transport connection** – fixed issue where server was not connecting properly in stdio mode:
  - Server now correctly detects stdio mode when launched by MCP Inspector
  - Tools are properly registered and available when connecting via stdio
  - Resolved connection issues that prevented tools from being listed

### Dependencies
- Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/connection` to `^0.1.12`:
  - Connection package no longer reads `.env` files or depends on `dotenv`
  - Consumers must pass `SapConfig` directly to connection constructors
- Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` to `^0.1.27`:
  - Updated to work with connection@0.1.12
  - Fixed example scripts to use manual `.env` parsing

## [1.1.15] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- **Git tag management** – fixed issues with release tag creation and management:
  - Corrected tag placement on the latest commit with CHANGELOG updates
  - Ensured proper tag synchronization between local and remote repositories
  - Fixed tag deletion and recreation workflow for release management

## [1.1.14] - 2025-01-27

### Added
- **Command-line flags --version/-v and --help/-h** – added support for standard command-line flags:
  - `--version` or `-v` – displays package version and exits
  - `--help` or `-h` – displays help message and exits
  - Flags are processed before any other initialization, allowing quick version/help checks

### Changed
- **.env file search logic** – improved .env file discovery and loading:
  - **Search location:** Now searches for `.env` file only in the current working directory (where the command is executed)
  - **No recursive search:** Removed fallback searches in parent directories or project root
  - **Explicit path support:** Still supports `--env=/path/to/.env` or `MCP_ENV_PATH` environment variable for custom locations
  - **Cross-platform paths:** Uses `path.resolve()` and `path.join()` for proper path handling on Windows, Linux, and macOS

- **Transport mode and .env file relationship** – refined logic for transport mode selection and .env file requirements:
  - **Default behavior:** If transport is not explicitly specified and no `.env` file is found, server starts in HTTP mode (no .env required)
  - **Explicit transport with .env:** If transport is explicitly set to `stdio` or `sse` but `.env` file is missing, server exits with clear error message
  - **Explicit transport without .env:** If transport is explicitly set to `http` or `streamable-http`, server starts without .env file (as expected)
  - **Error messages:** Improved error messages that clearly indicate what transport mode requires .env file and how to specify custom .env location

### Fixed
- **Cross-platform compatibility** – ensured all file path operations work correctly on Windows, Linux, and macOS:
  - All path operations use Node.js `path` module methods (`path.join()`, `path.resolve()`, `path.isAbsolute()`)
  - Proper handling of Windows path separators (`\`) vs Unix path separators (`/`)
  - Version reading from `package.json` uses cross-platform path resolution

## [1.1.13] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- **Handler parameter schemas alignment with CrudClient** – comprehensive fix to ensure all handler input schemas match actual CrudClient method parameters:
  - **Data Element handlers:**
    - Added `type_name` parameter to `handleCreateDataElement` schema (was missing but used in code)
    - Added `search_help`, `search_help_parameter`, `set_get_parameter` to `handleUpdateDataElement` schema (now properly passed to builder)
    - Updated field label descriptions to clarify they are applied during update step after creation
  - **Domain handlers:**
    - Removed unsupported parameters from `handleCreateDomain` low-level handler: `domain_type`, `application`, `master_system`, `responsible`
  - **Program handlers:**
    - Removed `master_system` and `responsible` from both high and low-level handlers (these are set automatically by system)
  - **Class handlers:**
    - Removed `master_system` and `responsible` from high-level handler schema (set automatically by system)
    - Removed `master_system` and `responsible` from low-level handler schema and code
  - **Interface handlers:**
    - Removed `master_system` and `responsible` from both high and low-level handlers (set automatically by system)
  - **Structure, View, Table handlers:**
    - Removed `master_system` and `responsible` from low-level create handlers (set automatically by system)
  - **Behavior Definition, Metadata Extension handlers:**
    - Removed `master_system` and `responsible` from low-level create handlers (set automatically by system)
  - **Impact:** All handler schemas now accurately reflect what parameters are actually supported and used by CrudClient methods, preventing confusion and ensuring correct API usage

### Changed
- **Data Element handlers – search help support** – enhanced data element handlers to support search help configuration:
  - `handleCreateDataElement` now accepts `search_help`, `search_help_parameter`, `set_get_parameter` parameters
  - `handleUpdateDataElement` now accepts `search_help`, `search_help_parameter`, `set_get_parameter` parameters
  - These parameters are properly passed through to `DataElementBuilder` and included in update operations
  - Enables full configuration of search help and parameter settings for data elements

### Dependencies
- **Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` to `^0.1.26`** – upgraded to latest version which includes:
  - Added `searchHelp`, `searchHelpParameter`, `setGetParameter` to `DataElementBuilderConfig`
  - Updated `DataElementBuilder.update()` to pass search help parameters to `UpdateDataElementParams`
  - Full support for search help configuration in data element operations

## [1.1.11] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- **DomainHighHandlers - Update workflow detection bug** – fixed critical issue where domain update operations were incorrectly using CREATE workflow instead of UPDATE workflow:
  - **Root cause:** `DomainBuilder.update()` method determines which workflow to use (CREATE vs UPDATE) by checking if `this.state.createResult` exists. When `CrudClient.getDomainBuilder()` reuses a builder instance from a previous `createDomain()` call, the builder still has `createResult` in its state, causing `update()` to incorrectly use CREATE workflow (`upload()` function) instead of UPDATE workflow (`updateDomain()` function).
  - **Solution:** Modified `handleUpdateDomain` to pass `packageName` directly to `lockDomain()` call, ensuring the builder is created with correct configuration from the start. This prevents builder reuse issues and ensures proper workflow detection.
  - **Additional fix:** Removed redundant validation step from `handleUpdateDomain` handler. The validation was checking if domain exists, but `lockDomain()` will fail if domain doesn't exist anyway, making the validation step unnecessary and potentially causing confusion.
  - **Impact:** Domain update operations now correctly use UPDATE workflow for existing domains, preventing "Domain already exists" errors that were occurring when the system tried to create an already-existing domain.

### Changed
- **DomainHighHandlers test logging** – completely refactored test logging system for better information density and clarity:
  - **Removed verbose `debugLog()` system** – eliminated all `debugLog()` calls that were cluttering test output with verbose JSON structures and nested data objects
  - **Introduced concise logging** – replaced with simple, informative `console.log()` statements that provide clear, actionable information:
    - Clear operation names (e.g., "High Create: Creating domain...", "High Update: Updating domain...")
    - Success/failure status with object names
    - Skip reasons when tests are skipped
    - Visual infographics (emojis) for quick visual scanning of test output
  - **Simplified error handling** – removed redundant try-catch blocks and verbose error logging, now relies on Jest's native error handling which provides better stack traces
  - **More informative output** – each log statement now provides essential information (operation type, object name, status) without JSON noise
  - **Consistent with other tests** – matches logging patterns used in BehaviorDefinitionHighHandlers, PackageHighHandlers, and other high-level handler tests
  - **Better maintainability** – removed ~50 lines of verbose debug logging code, making tests easier to read and maintain
  - **Improved debugging** – concise logs make it easier to identify which operation failed and why, without scrolling through JSON dumps

### Dependencies
- **Updated `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` to `^0.1.25`** – upgraded to latest version which includes:
  - Improved `DomainBuilder.update()` workflow detection logic
  - Better handling of CREATE vs UPDATE workflow selection based on builder state
  - Enhanced error messages for domain operations

### Documentation
- **Test Issues Roadmap** – comprehensive update to development roadmap:
  - **Issue #10 (DomainHighHandlers)** – changed status from "Expected Skip" to "Fixed" with detailed explanation
  - **Updated statistics:** 8 fixed issues (was 7), 1 expected skip (was 3)
  - **Added detailed problem analysis:** Documented root cause, solution approach, and code changes
  - **Improved issue tracking:** Better categorization of issues vs expected skips vs cloud limitations

### Development Process
- **Issue Roadmap System** – introduced systematic problem analysis and resolution tracking:
  - **New workflow:** Test failures are now systematically analyzed and documented in `doc/development/TEST_ISSUES_ROADMAP_*.md`
  - **Issue classification:** Problems are categorized as Simple (⚡) or Complex (🔍), with clear distinction between real issues and expected skips
  - **Problem analysis:** Each issue includes detailed error messages, root cause analysis, solution approach, and code references
  - **Progress tracking:** Roadmap maintains statistics on fixed vs pending vs expected issues, providing clear visibility into test suite health
  - **Solution documentation:** All fixes are documented with code references, making it easier to understand what was changed and why
  - **Continuous improvement:** Roadmap is updated after each test run, ensuring it reflects current state and helps prioritize future work
  - **Benefits:** Enables faster problem resolution, prevents duplicate work, and provides historical context for similar issues

## [1.1.10] - 2025-11-27

### Added
- **Behavior Implementation integration tests** – added comprehensive integration tests for Behavior Implementation handlers:
  - `BehaviorImplementationLowHandlers.test.ts` – full workflow test: Validate → Create → Check → Lock → Update → Unlock → Activate
  - `BehaviorImplementationHighHandlers.test.ts` – high-level handler test: CreateClass → Update implementations include → DeleteClass
  - Both tests include detailed step-by-step logging for better visibility and debugging
  - Tests use `implementationCode` parameter for custom implementations include code
  - Proper cleanup logic ensures test objects are deleted only if successfully created
- **Test configuration parameter for Behavior Implementation** – added `implementation_code` parameter:
  - Separate parameter for updating implementations include (local handler class) in low-level handler tests
  - `update_source_code` parameter for high-level handler tests
  - Updated test templates with correct implementation code structure
  - Improved test configuration clarity and maintainability

### Changed
- **Behavior Implementation HighHandlers test** – simplified test implementation:
  - Removed manual session state management (save/restore) – CrudClient now manages session internally
  - Removed low-level handler imports (`handleLockClass`, `handleUnlockClass`, `handleActivateClass`)
  - Test now uses only CrudClient methods for lock → update → unlock → activate workflow
  - Aligns with high-level handler pattern where each handler manages its own session and lock/unlock operations
- **Behavior Implementation handlers** – updated to use types from `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients`:
  - All handler parameter types now imported from `adt-clients` package
  - Ensures type consistency across handlers and client library
  - `handleCreateBehaviorImplementation` now correctly uses `BehaviorImplementationBuilderConfig` type

### Fixed
- **Behavior Implementation test configuration** – fixed test configuration for managed behavior definitions:
  - Removed `read FOR READ` method from implementation code examples in `test-config.yaml` and `test-config.yaml.template`
  - For managed behavior definitions, `read` method is auto-generated and should not be included in custom implementation code
  - Updated both low-level and high-level test configurations with correct implementation code structure
  - Tests now correctly handle managed behavior implementation classes without superfluous `read` method errors

## [1.1.10] - 2025-11-26

### Added
- **Client Connection Isolation**: Implemented per-session connection isolation to prevent data mixing between different clients
  - Each client session now maintains its own isolated SAP connection based on `sessionId` and configuration hash
  - Connections are cached per unique combination of `sessionId` + `sapUrl` + authentication parameters
  - Uses `AsyncLocalStorage` to pass session context to handlers, ensuring each request uses the correct connection
  - Prevents race conditions where concurrent requests from different clients could overwrite each other's connection settings
  - Backward compatible: falls back to global connection cache for non-HTTP transports (stdio)

- **Non-Local Connection Restrictions**: Added security restrictions for non-local connections
  - **SSE Transport**: Always restricted to localhost connections only (127.0.0.1, ::1, localhost)
  - **HTTP Transport**: Non-local connections are restricted when:
    - `.env` file exists (was found at startup)
    - AND request does not include SAP connection headers (`x-sap-url`, `x-sap-auth-type`)
  - Non-local connections with SAP headers are allowed (enables multi-tenant scenarios)
  - Local connections are always allowed regardless of `.env` file presence
  - Clear error messages guide users when connections are rejected

### Changed
- **Connection Management**: Refactored `getManagedConnection()` to support session-based connection caching
  - Added `generateConnectionCacheKey()` function to create unique cache keys from sessionId and config signature
  - Implemented `getConnectionForSession()` to retrieve or create session-specific connections
  - Added automatic cleanup of old connection cache entries (older than 1 hour)
  - Each session uses unique `sessionId` for its `AbapConnection` to prevent session mixing

- **Session Tracking**: Enhanced `streamableHttpSessions` to store SAP configuration per session
  - Added `sapConfig` field to session objects to track configuration per client
  - `applyAuthHeaders()` now stores configuration in session object
  - Session cleanup automatically removes associated connection from cache

### Security
- **Connection Isolation**: Prevents one client from receiving another client's data when multiple clients connect to different SAP systems
- **Access Control**: Restricts non-local access when `.env` file is present, requiring explicit SAP headers for remote connections

## [1.1.9] - 2025-11-24

### Added
- **DDLX (Metadata Extension) Management Tools**:
  - `CreateMetadataExtension`: Create new ABAP Metadata Extensions (DDLX) with automatic activation
  - `UpdateMetadataExtension`: Update source code of existing Metadata Extensions

  - Support for root entity specification and implementation type selection
  - Transport request validation integrated
- **Full Low-Level CRUD Coverage**:
  - Added dedicated `create`, `lock`, `unlock`, `check`, `validate`, `delete`, and `update` handlers for classes, programs, interfaces, function groups/modules, domains, data elements, packages, tables, views, structures, transports, and more to cover every `CrudClient` method.
  - Each handler now has a consistent naming scheme (`CreateX`, `UpdateX`, etc.) to match the high-level counterparts.

- **System Management Tools**:
  - `GetInactiveObjects`: Retrieve list of inactive ABAP objects (objects that have been modified but not activated)
  - Provides count and detailed list of objects waiting for activation
  - Useful for monitoring development progress and identifying objects requiring attention

### Changed
- **Handler Organization Refactoring**: All handlers reorganized into categorized subdirectories with explicit `high/`, `low/`, and `readonly/` layers for better maintainability. Each low-level handler description now starts with `[low-level]`, and every read handler was moved to the new `readonly/` folders and tagged `[read-only]`. This improves discoverability, enforces single-responsibility boundaries, and makes it clear which tools mutate SAP data.
  - `bdef/` - Behavior Definition handlers (GetBdef, CreateBehaviorDefinition, UpdateBehaviorDefinition)
  - `class/` - Class handlers (GetClass, CreateClass, UpdateClass, ValidateClass, CheckClass)
  - `common/` - Common handlers (ActivateObject, DeleteObject, CheckObject, LockObject, UnlockObject, ValidateObject)
  - `data_element/` - Data Element handlers (GetDataElement, CreateDataElement, UpdateDataElement)
  - `ddlx/` - Metadata Extension handlers (CreateMetadataExtension, UpdateMetadataExtension)
  - `domain/` - Domain handlers (GetDomain, CreateDomain, UpdateDomain)
  - `enhancement/` - Enhancement handlers (GetEnhancements, GetEnhancementImpl, GetEnhancementSpot)
  - `function/` - Function handlers (GetFunction, GetFunctionGroup, CreateFunctionGroup, CreateFunctionModule, UpdateFunctionModule, ValidateFunctionModule, CheckFunctionModule)
  - `include/` - Include handlers (GetInclude, GetIncludesList)
  - `interface/` - Interface handlers (GetInterface, CreateInterface, UpdateInterface)
  - `package/` - Package handlers (GetPackage, CreatePackage)
  - `program/` - Program handlers (GetProgram, CreateProgram, UpdateProgram)
  - `search/` - Search handlers (SearchObject, GetObjectsByType, GetObjectsList)
  - `structure/` - Structure handlers (GetStructure, CreateStructure)
  - `system/` - System handlers (GetTypeInfo, GetTransaction, GetSqlQuery, GetWhereUsed, GetObjectInfo, GetSession, GetAbapAST, GetAbapSemanticAnalysis, GetAbapSystemSymbols, GetAllTypes, GetObjectStructure, GetObjectNodeFromCache, GetInactiveObjects)
  - `table/` - Table handlers (GetTable, GetTableContents, CreateTable, ValidateTable, CheckTable)
  - `transport/` - Transport handlers (GetTransport, CreateTransport)
  - `view/` - View handlers (GetView, CreateView, UpdateView)
  - This reorganization improves code navigation, reduces merge conflicts, and makes the codebase more maintainable

- **Dependencies Updated**:
  - `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients`: ^0.1.9 → ^0.1.12
  - `@mcp-abap-adt/connection`: ^0.1.4 → ^0.1.9
  - Updated to leverage new CrudClient methods for DDLX and BDEF operations

- **Index and Tools Registry Updates**:
  - `src/index.ts`: Updated all handler imports to reflect new subdirectory structure
  - `src/lib/toolsRegistry.ts`: Updated tool definitions imports to match new handler locations
  - All 81 handler files moved and imports updated consistently
- **Tooling Improvements**:
  - `tools/generate-tools-docs.js` now outputs a navigation tree that mirrors the document structure, separates high-/low-/read-only tools, and adds summary counts for each level.
  - `doc/user-guide/AVAILABLE_TOOLS.md` regenerated to include the new navigation, level-specific anchors, and the `[read-only]` marker.
  - Test suite, configs, and helper scripts updated to follow the new directory layout and renamed high-level handlers (`UpdateClass`, `UpdateProgram`, etc.).
- **Low-Level Tool Names**:
  - Every low-level handler now advertises a unique MCP tool name suffixed with `Low` (e.g., `CreateClassLow`, `UpdateDomainLow`, `LockPackageLow`). This prevents `Tool <name> is already registered` errors when both low/high versions exist and keeps the server compatible with clients that look up tools by name.

### Documentation
- Added `implementation_plan.md`: Plan for future refactoring of read handlers to `src/readers` directory
- Removed `roadmap.md`: Work items are complete, so the standalone roadmap is no longer required

  - Fixed STDIO connection to use `mcpServer.server.connect(transport)` pattern
  - Removed unused imports: `Server`, `CallToolRequestSchema`, `ListToolsRequestSchema`

### Added
- **SSE Development Tool**: Created `tools/dev-sse.js` for proper SSE server development workflow
  - Launches SSE server on port 3001 (default)
  - Automatically starts MCP Inspector with correct SSE endpoint (`http://localhost:3001/sse`)

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New MCP tool: `DetectObjectTypeList`
  - Batch detection of ABAP object types by a list of names.
  - Input: `{ global: [{ name: string, type?: string }] }`
  - Output: `{ isError: boolean, content: Array<{ name, detectedType, description, shortText, longText, text, package, uri }> }`
  - Available via MCP API and web interface.
  - All comments and documentation in English.

### Changed
- All handler modules now use a unified in-memory caching mechanism via `objectsListCache`. This provides consistent, easily swappable cache logic across the codebase.
- The `filePath` parameter and all file write logic have been removed from all handlers. Handler results are now only cached in memory, not written to disk.
- This refactor improves maintainability, testability, and performance by eliminating redundant file operations and centralizing cache management.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
