# verify-sap.ps1 - verify wrapper for live-SAP targets (Phase 0a skeleton).
#
# Marker contract (DESIGN.md section 9 - failure classification):
#   CODE_FAIL - code defect; eligible as a rule-promotion candidate
#   ENV_FAIL  - connectivity/auth/system failure; never promote to rules
#   LOCK_FAIL - transient lock (transport/enqueue); never promote to rules
# vsp exits 1 on every error type, so classification relies on output
# pattern parsing only.
#
# Phase 0b (2026-07-11): measured real output for all three markers against
# IDES-DEV (S4H/100) - see adapters/vsp/COMMANDS.md and .harness/STATE.md for
# the raw captures. Classification below matches the measured strings first,
# falling back to the original keyword heuristic when a measured string does
# not match (covers failure shapes not yet observed). Remaining TODO: the
# ENV_FAIL "403" fallback keyword has no measured non-lock case backing it
# (the one measured 403 was LOCK_FAIL) - kept as an unverified fallback only.
#
# PowerShell 5.1 compatible. ASCII only.
